Create a sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with the numbers 1-9 so that each column, row, and 3x3 sub-grid (or box) contains one of each digit. The variables are named by row and column, and are valued from 1 to 9 subject to the constraints that no two cells in the same row, column, or box may be the same. We give value zero to a tile that has not yet been filled.In the starter zip, sudokus start.txt, contains hundreds of sample unsolved Sudoku boards, and sudokus finish.txt the corresponding solutions. Each board is represented as a single line of text, starting from the top-left corner of the board, and listed left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
